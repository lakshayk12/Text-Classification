Hi, This project is done using Pycharm IDE.
Some considerations:
- extract DATA.rar for training and testing data.
- class_list.txt contains all classes names.
- feature_set.txt contains top k selected features.
- stopwords.txt contains stopwords.
- Test.csv & Train.csv are already here but will be made while running code.
- code is in "main.py" file.
- vocabulary.txt contains vocabulary of whole training data (from which top k features are to be selected).

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- some additional python packages.

- Data.rar contain data of newspaper articles with folders as Class name.
- first you need to make Train.csv and Test.csv using suitable functions available in code.

Thank You.
